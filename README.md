This mod allows you to load more than two shells in a shotgun.

This mod does not give you infinite ammo, it only allows you to load a lot of bullets in the shotgun so that you free up inventory space.

Use the [ShowAmmoCount Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/SoraYuki/ShowAmmoCount/) to see how many bullets you have.

If you are using the [BetterShotgun Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Hypick/BetterShotgun/), then uninstall this one and enable the "ReloadNoLimit" option in the BetterShotgun config file.
